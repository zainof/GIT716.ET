Data
************

To run the ETLook model, two types of spatial variables are required, temporal and static data. Each of these variables can be collected from whichever source you wish to use, as long as you make sure the units are correct and the projection consistent.

For your convenience, the pyWaPOR package has a function that can collect the required data from selected sources and make sure the data is stored in the correct format and folder structure.

If you are interested in using data from sources not listed below, please have a look at the "sideloading" notebook in the User Guide.
