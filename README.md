- click on you name, the branch name should change
- After this then you can start editing and making changes to the code
- When you are done make sure you commit the changes to your branch only
- committing to main may cause conflicts 

# Idea for execution 
- each person will work on their own branch from which they will be able to edit and make changes to the code and not affect the other peoples work. This will allow us to work on different sections or part of the code simultaneously.
